# It first constructs a synthetic graph that will be used as input.  The graph
# is clustered, with edge density being high within clusters and low between 
# clusters.  The algorithm when run on this input will produce a generalized
# graph whose supernodes will generally correspond to the clusters (i.e., 
# nodes in the same cluster will be assigned to the same supernode).
# Each node in the synthetic graph has a name like "g10n2" indicating it is 
# node 2 in group 10.  Thus, in the generalized graph, if the nodes within 
# each supernode have the same graph number, this is an indication that the 
# algorithm partitioned the nodes into the "right" groups.
#
# This code also shows how to sample a simple graph from the generalized graph
# representation.  It also compares the clustering coefficient of the input 
# graph with the clustering coefficient of the sampled graph.

# ABOUT INPUT GRAPH:
# input graph is a toy graph that is highly clustered:
# 	- 20 clusters, each with 10 nodes, a total of 200 nodes
#	- for each possible edge (200 choose 2)
#	- insert edge between (u,v) with probability p where 
#	- p = .25 if (u,v) in same cluster
#	- p = .05 if (u,v) in different clusters
